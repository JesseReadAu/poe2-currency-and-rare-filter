## About
An item filter for Path of Exile 2, an action RPG which drops many different items with different values and rarity.

This filter uses many rules to determine the apperances and sound of item labels that appear inside of the game when an item is dropped.

The aim of this filter is play sounds on currency drops and valuable drops while still showing rare and valuable items.

This filter uses the in-game filter system provided by the game developers Grinding Gear Games, and is not a hack or cheat. This filter does not work with console versions of the game.

## Filter Summary
1. Large Text, Sound, Map Icon.
    * Currency
    * Gems
    * Tablets
    * Rare Amulet, Belt and Rings
    * Unique Items
    * Waypoints
2. Small Text
    * Salvage items under 4 slots
3. Text, Map Icon
    * Large Sums of Gold
4. Hidden
    * Everything Else

If an item or class of item has been missed the filter should it would show as if there was no filter. This is likely a bug or new item, I encourage you to report it here on GitHub.
